This is the 2nd version of the Pancake layout based on an Ortho 4x12 matrix

V1 updated the Rev2.c file from the main Spaceman folder in order to get the display to work

V2 will leave the Rev2.c file unchanged but add new <keyboardname.h> and <keyboardname.c> files

This readme will be udated once testing is complete.
