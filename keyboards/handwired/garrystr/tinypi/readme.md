***Keyboard Desgin abondoned***
***Too Small and not enough space between keys***


An attempt to make a minimal keyboard that is integrated with a Raspberry Pi4B+

A sort of portable computer!

ortho 4 x 10 some of the keys are not in place so are not defined.

Very small keyboard with close keys due to the key plate
