# Handwired Ergonomic Ortho Custom Keyboard

This is a handwired keyboard designed specifically for my work based workflow

It uses a number of 3D printed parts that have been glued together.

There is a custom matrix as I used a basic (cheap) pro-micro that did not have suffucient pins for a 14x5 Matrix

This would have required 19 I/O pins with the pro-micro having 18.

The matrix is therefore 7 Rows and 10 columns which meant only 17 I/O pins were needed leaving 1 for RGB control.

This was only achievable by handwiring the switches.

I made some layout choices based on a couple of requirements, with the origianl keymap having a Dvorak default layer.
Subsequent updates included the ability to change the default layer, copied from the Let's Split keyboard.

# To Do

* Add 3D Printer files and build details
* Add layout to ReadMe so this shows the display
* Add details of Matirx and wiring.

# Known Issues

* Keys repeating or not responding - this has recently become an issue, I think this may be due to a short occuring.
